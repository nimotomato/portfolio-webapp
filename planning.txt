Header with name etc: Hi I'm Martin. I love code.

Then three preview boxes which grow when hovered over. When clicked, the view splits in two; site and github. Each new view is a link.

These things can also be found by scrolling down. When not active, items are blurred. When active, they sharpen into focus.
