    "I've worked as a clinical psychologist for almost six years. \
I started out working mostly with therapy, but the last couple of years I've only been doing neuropsychological assessments. \
Last summer, I started coding and I've been hooked since. Currently I'm aiming for a Bachelor's degree in computer science. \
I hope to combine programming with my previous expertise.",
